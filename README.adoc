== Description

A general-purpose status icon for the system tray. It watches a simple JSON
configuration file for changes.  That file describes what the icon should
be, as well as what message should be shown.

== Requirements

Qt 5.x and a platform with a system tray. This should be most common platforms.

== Installation

To build, run the following:

  qmake
  make
  sudo make install

== Use

Create a file containing the following:

  {"iconfile": "/usr/share/icons/oxygen/64x64/actions/dialog-ok.png", "title": "Status notifier", "message": "It works!"}

Save this into a file, such as +~/.config/statusicon+

Then, run the following command:

  statusicon ~/.config/statusicon

The icon should appear in your system tray / task panel.  Now, edit the file to contain the following:

  {"iconfile": "/usr/share/icons/oxygen/64x64/actions/dialog-cancel.png", "title": "Status notifier", "message": "Uh oh. Something broke."}

When you save the file, the icon should change, and the message should be displayed.

This is meant as a minimalist utility to help other tools report their status.
